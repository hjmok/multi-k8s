#so we make one config file per object we want to create. Objects serve various purposes, such as running a container, monitoring a container, setting up a network, etc. This purpose/object type is first determined by the "kind:" parameter
apiVersion: apps/v1 #Each apiVersion defines a different set of object types that we can create within the configuration file. So selecting apps/v1 opens up access to a predefined set of different object types, including Deployment
kind: Deployment #kind is the object type
#so a Deployment is like a Pod, but better for production environments. Whereas pods run a single set of containers, Deployment runs a set of identical pods and monitors the state of each pod, updating as necessary

metadata:
  name: server-deployment #name of the Deployment that got created

spec:
  replicas: 3 #number of different pods that this Deployment will make using the template below
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: server #so after the Deployment creates its pods, the Deployment needs to be able to get a handle on the newly created pods. To do this, the Deployment looks for objects with a key-value pair label of component: server, which is specified in the template below

  template:
    #template lists out the configuration that is going to be used for every single pod made within this Deployment
    #below is the same configuration set up we used in client-pod.yaml
    metadata:
      labels:
        component: server #so this Pod is connected to our Service (clusterIP) by Selector:Component:server in the server-cluster-ip-service.yaml file.
    #The label name is arbitrary as well, it did not need to be component:server as the key value pair. Any key and value could've been used so long as they match in both files
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: server
          image: hjmok/multi-server
          ports:
            - containerPort: 5000 #this is the port that will be made accessible on the image that gets created inside each pod. Basically the port within our pod that we want to route our input and output traffic to from the server
          env: #environment variables
            #So the multi-server needs to connect to Redis and Postgres, so we're setting up it's environment variables
